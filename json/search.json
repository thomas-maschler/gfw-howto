      "content"  : "  Read below to learn how to manage subscriptions for your areas of interest. When you subscribe to alerts for an area you will be notified of new forest change via emails. Each email contains new activity detected by GFW’s Tree Cover Change or alert systems. Please be aware that not all alert systems may cover the area you selected. To learn more about each system, click on the information icons that appear in the drop-down menu under Forest Change on the interactive map.  1. To view and manage your subscriptions, log in to My GFW using the “Log in to My GFW” button in the toolbar at the top of the page. (Log in with your Twitter, Facebook, or Google account).    2. Once you are logged in, click on the “Subscriptions” drop down option in the top toolbar under “My GFW”.     3. You can then view all of your subscriptions, the data set that you are subscribed to for each area, and the date that you subscribed. To rename a subscription, click on the name of the subscription.     4. You can also view your subscription on the Interactive Map by clicking on the “View on Map” button on the right-hand side of the page, or delete your subscription.    5. If you see this icon next to any of your subscriptions, it means they have not been confirmed. Check your email for a link to confirm your subscription.     6. You can also create a profile on My GFW, which helps us understand how Global Forest Watch data and features are used.   "

      "content"  : "  Raster refers to a type of spatial data, which defines space by pixels, or equally sized cells arranged by rows and columns. Each pixel contains a single attribute value and its coordinate location. Pixel values correspond to real-world features such as the year tree cover was lost, or the percent of canopy cover in that location.  Steps to download raster data in the ODP:  1. Find and open a raster data set in the Open Data Portal, for example, tree cover loss.  2. Since global data sets cannot be downloaded for the entire world, use the interactive web-map to zoom in on your area of interest. The extent of the web-map will determine the extent of your data, when downloaded.    3. Select &quot;DOWNLOAD DATASET&quot; and choose one of the data types under the “Download Filtered Dataset” section. The TIFF format is encoded with raster values and is spatially referenced so you can add it to a GIS.    4. Once you select a download format from the “DOWNLOAD DATASET” button, your download will begin. Download times may vary based on the size of your data request. Having trouble downloading a data set? Let us know!  Steps to Download Raster Data by Country:  The easiest way to download the tree cover loss raster data set for an entire country is to search for that country in the Open Data Portal. The GFW team is committed to making more of our global raster data sets downloadable by country.  1. From the Open Data Portal homepage navigate to the “VIEW COUNTRY DATA” search box.    2. Use the drop-down menu to select a country of interest. for example, Brazil.  3. In the search results page, select the tree cover loss data for that country (Brazil tree cover loss), and your download should start immediately.  "

View UMD/Google Data    View FORMA data    View Imazon Data    View QUICC Data    Learn more about individual data points and polygons  Some data layers allow you to click on individual data points and polygons (i.e., shapes) to view additional information. This feature applies to NASA active fires (within the Forest Change tab) and/or data within the Forest Use, Conservation, People, and Stories tabs.  1.  Select a data layer, noting that this feature only applies to certain layers (see above).  2.  Click on the data point or polygon you want to learn more about and an information window will appear. Note: You can analyze Forest Change data within individual land-use concessions and protected areas by selecting the analysis button in the information window. Click the Analyze Forest Change tab on this page for step-by-step guidance.  Visualize global data on the GFW Interactive Map  1.  Navigate to the GFW Interactive Map.  2.  Available data layers are organized by category within the Data Layers drop down menu. Tap on Global Data or Country Data and then search through the categories to select the data layer(s) you want to display. Once the layers are selected, tap Go to Map. Tree cover loss and gain are displayed by default.      &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img10.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img11-1.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img12.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;    3.  Tap the information icon next to each layer name to learn more about each data layer. This includes information such as data resolution, frequency, cautions, and a link to learn more or download the data set on the Open Data Portal.  &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img13-1.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;  4.  View activated layers by tapping on the data legend on the right-hand side of the map.  &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img14-1.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;  5.  For data layers that cover a limited geographic region, you can turn on “Geographic coverage” in the data legend to see the geographic extent of the data layer on the map.  &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img51-1.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;  6.  For tree cover loss and tree cover extent data layers, you can adjust the tree canopy density of your data display and analysis by tapping on the highlighted percent canopy density within the legend.  &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img15-1.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;  7.  Share your map view, zoom in and out, refresh the page, search the Google base map and geo-locate your position using the buttons along the right side of the map.  &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img14-2.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;  8.  Change the base map to view data with a different map background. Tap on the Data Layers button and then the Basemaps button. Once you select a basemap, tap Return to Map.    &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img11-3.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img16.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;    Visualize data for different time periods  For most data layers under the Forest Change tab, the default view shows cumulative data points over the entire study period. However, most of these layers can also be viewed for other specified time periods. The specific time intervals (e.g., annual, monthly, and daily) vary for each data layer.  1.  Select the Forest Change data layer you want to view.  2.  On the bottom of the map, locate the timeline and select the period for which you would like to view data.  &amp;lt;%= image_tag(&#39;howto-screenshots-mobile/img17.png&#39;) %&amp;gt;  Learn more about individual data points and polygons  Some data layers allow you to click on individual data points and polygons (i.e., shapes) to view additional information.  1.  Select a data layer(s) under the Global Data and Country Data tabs.  2.  Tap on the data point or polygon you want to learn more about and an information window will appear.  4.  You can analyze Forest Change data within individual points or polygons by tapping on the Analyze button at the bottom of the information window."
