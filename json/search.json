Click through the tabs to select the data layer(s) you want to display. Tree cover loss and gain are displayed by default.    3.  Click the information icon in the drop down menu to learn more about each data layer. This includes information such as data resolution, frequency, cautions, and a link to learn more or download the data set on the Open Data Portal.    4.  View activated layers in the data legend on the left-hand side of the map.    For data layers that cover a limited geographic region, you can turn on “Geographic coverage” in the data legend to see the geographic extent of the data layer on the map.    For tree cover and tree cover loss data layers, you can adjust the tree canopy density of your data display and analysis by clicking on the highlighted percent canopy density within the legend.    5.  Zoom in and out, share your map view, hide the windows, search the Google base map, and refresh the page using the buttons located on the bottom left-hand side of the map.    6.  Change the base map to view data with a different map background.

However, most of these layers can also be viewed as a time series. The specific time intervals (e.g., annual, monthly, daily) vary for each data layer.  1.  Select the Forest Change data layer you want to view as a time series.  2.  On the bottom of the map, locate the timeline.  3.  Some timelines allow you to animate the data over time or select a time interval. Press the play button on the left to view an animation of the entire time series or drag the ends of the timeline to select a specific period of time.    4.

Companies can monitor the impacts of commodity supply chains on forests and demonstrate compliance with sustainability commitments and certifications. Learn more at GFW Commodities.  NGOs &amp; civil society can identify deforestation hotspots and bolster their investigations, advocacy, and campaigns.  Indigenous communities can monitor their territories and raise an alarm when their customary forests are threatened.  Media can gather evidence, data, and graphics for reporting.  Researchers can analyze forest trends on a local or global scale and better understand the causes of forest change.  Concerned citizens everywhere can learn more about the state of forests and participate in forest monitoring. Students and educators can learn more about forests at local and global scales."

Companies can monitor the impacts of commodity supply chains on forests and demonstrate compliance with sustainability commitments and certifications. Learn more at GFW Commodities.  NGOs &amp; civil society can identify deforestation hotspots and bolster their investigations, advocacy, and campaigns.  Indigenous communities can monitor their territories and raise an alarm when their customary forests are threatened.  Media can gather evidence, data, and graphics for reporting.  Researchers can analyze forest trends on a local or global scale and better understand the causes of forest change.  Concerned citizens everywhere can learn more about the state of forests and participate in forest monitoring. Students and educators can learn more about forests at local and global scales."
